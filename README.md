# Hangman

## What it is?
A simple hangman game played in the terminal.
User has 5 lives to guess the right word by providing one letter at the time.

## How it works?
User will be promped to provide a letter in order to guess a given word.
If the given word contains the letter, it will be shown to the user.
Otherwise it will count as an error and the number of lives will decrease.
The game ends when the user either guesses the word or looses all lives.

## How to intall it?
Just download the code. In the terminal run `python3 main.py` from its directory
